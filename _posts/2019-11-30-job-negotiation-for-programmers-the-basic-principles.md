## Job negotiation for programmers: the basic principles
程序员找工作谈判的基本原则

You need to negotiate at a new job: for your salary, or benefits, or my personal favorite, a shorter workweek. You’re not sure what to do, or how to approach it, or what to say when the company says “how much do you want?” or “here’s our offer—what do you say?”
你需要就一份新工作进行协商:比如你的薪水、福利，或者我个人最喜欢的每周工作时间缩短。当公司问你“你想要多少?”或者“这是我们的报价，你觉得怎么样呢?”

Here’s the thing: that final conversation about salary might be the most nerve-wracking part, but the negotiation process starts much much earlier. **Which means you can enter that final conversation having positioned yourself for success—and feeling less stressed about it too.**
事情是这样的:最后关于薪资的谈话可能是最伤脑筋的部分，但谈判过程开始得要早得多。这意味着你可以进入最后的对话，为自己的成功做好准备，同时也会感到更少的压力。

The way you can do that is following certain basic principles, which I’ll be covering in this article. I’m going to be focusing on salary negotiation as an example, but the same principles will apply when negotiating for a shorter workweek.
实现这一点的方法是遵循某些基本原则，我将在本文中介绍这些原则。我将以薪资谈判为例，但同样的原则也适用于缩短工作周的谈判。

In particular, I’ll be talking about:
具体来说，我要讲的是

1. An example from early in my career when I negotiated very very badly.
   举个例子，在我职业生涯的早期，我的谈判非常糟糕。

2. The right way to negotiate, based on four principles:
   谈判的正确方式，基于四个原则:

    1. Employment is a negotiated relationship.
       雇佣关系是一种谈判关系。
    2. Knowledge is power.
       知识就是力量。
    
    3. Negotiate from a position of strength.
       站在有利的位置谈判。
    
    4. Use the right tactics.
       使用正确的策略。

### The wrong way to negotiate
谈判的错误方式

Before moving on to the principles of negotiation, let me share a story of how I negotiated badly.
在讨论谈判原则之前，让我先分享一个我谈判失败的故事。

```
During my first real job search I interviewed at a company in New York City that was building a financial trading platform. They were pretty excited about some specific technologies I’d learned while working on Twisted, an open source networking framework. They offered me a job, I accepted, and my job search was over.
在我第一次真正找工作的时候，我面试了纽约市一家正在搭建金融交易平台的公司。他们对我在开发开放源码网络框架Twisted时学到的一些特定技术非常感兴趣。他们给了我一份工作，我接受了，我的求职之路也就结束了。

But then they sent me their intellectual property agreement, and I actually read legal documents; you should read them too. The agreement would have given the company ownership over any open source work I did, including work on Twisted. I wanted to ensure I could keep doing open source development, especially given that was their reason for hiring me in the first place. I asked for an exemption covering Twisted, they wouldn’t agree, and so we went back and forth trying to reach an agreement.
但后来他们把他们的知识产权协议发给了我，我真的读了法律文件;你也应该读一读。该协议将给予公司我所做的任何开源工作的所有权，包括Twisted的工作。我想要确保我可以继续做开源开发，特别是考虑到这是他们雇佣我的首要原因。我要求豁免涉及扭曲，他们不同意，所以我们来回试图达成协议。

Eventually they came back with a new offer: in return for not working on Twisted I’d get a 20% salary increase over their initial offer. I thought about it briefly, then said no and walked away from the job. Since I had neither a CS degree—I’d dropped out—nor much of an employment history, open source contribution was important to my career. It was how I’d gotten contracting work, and it was the reason they’d offered me this job. And I enjoyed doing it, too, so I wasn’t willing to give it up.
最后，他们给了我一份新工作:作为不为Twisted平台工作的回报，我的薪水将比他们最初的工作高出20%。我想了一下，然后说不，然后离开了这份工作。因为我既没有计算机科学学位——我已经退学了——也没有太多的工作经历，开源贡献对我的职业生涯很重要。这就是我获得承包工作的方式，也是他们给我这份工作的原因。我也喜欢这样做，所以我不愿意放弃。

I posted about this experience online, and an employee of ITA Software, which was based in the Boston area, suggested they were happy to support contributions to open source projects. It seemed worth a try, so I applied for the position. And when eventually I got a job offer from ITA and they asked me for my salary requirements, I asked for the second offer I’d gotten, the one that was 20% higher than my original offer. They accepted, and I’ve lived in the Boston area ever since.
我在网上发布了这段经历，ITA Software(总部位于波士顿地区)的一名员工表示，他们很乐意支持对开源项目的贡献。看来值得一试，所以我申请了这个职位。当我最终从ITA得到一份工作，他们问我对薪水的要求时，我又问了第二份工作，那份比我原来的工作高出20%。他们接受了，从那以后我就一直住在波士顿地区。
```

As we go through the principles below, I’ll come back to this story and point out how they were (mis)applied in my two negotiations.
当我们讨论下面的原则时，我将回到这个故事，并指出它们在我的两次谈判中是如何(错误地)应用的。

### The four principles of negotiation
谈判的四项原则

You can think of the negotiation process as building on four principles:
你可以把谈判过程想象成建立在四个原则之上:

1. Employment is a negotiated relationship.
   雇佣关系是一种谈判关系。

2. Knowledge is power.
   知识就是力量。

3. Negotiate from a position of strength.
   站在有利的位置谈判。

4. Use the right tactics.
   使用正确的策略。

Let’s go through them one by one.
让我们一个一个来看。

#### Principle #1: Employment is a negotiated relationship
原则1:雇佣关系是一种协商关系

If you’re an employee, your employment relationship was negotiated. When you got a job offer and accepted it, that was a negotiation, even if you didn’t push back at all. Your choice isn’t between negotiating and not negotiating: it’s between negotiating badly, or negotiating well.
如果你是雇员，你的雇佣关系是经过协商的。当你得到一份工作并接受了它，那就是一种谈判，即使你根本没有拒绝。你的选择不是在谈判和不谈判之间:而是在糟糕的谈判和良好的谈判之间。

##### Negotiate actively
积极协商

If you don’t actively try to negotiate, if you don’t ask for what you want, if you don’t ask for what you’re worth—you’re unlikely to get it. Salaries, for example, are a place where your interests and your employer’s are very much at odds. All things being equal, if you’re doing the exact same work and have the same likelihood of leaving, would your employer prefer to pay you less or more? Most employers will pay you less if they can, and I almost had to learn that the hard way.
如果你不主动尝试谈判，如果你不要求你想要的，如果你不要求你的价值——你不太可能得到它。例如，薪水就是一个你的兴趣和你老板的兴趣非常不一致的地方。在所有条件相同的情况下，如果你做的是完全一样的工作，离职的可能性也是一样的，那么你的雇主是愿意给你加薪还是减薪呢?如果可以的话，大多数雇主会给你更少的工资，我几乎是通过惨痛的教训才明白这一点的。

**Applying the principle**: In my story above, I never proactively negotiated. Instead, I accepted a job offer from the financial company without any sort of additional demands. If they were happy to offer me a 20% raise just to quit open source, I probably could have gotten an even higher salary if I’d just asked in the first place.
应用原则:在我上面的故事中，我从不主动谈判。相反，我接受了金融公司的工作邀请，没有任何附加要求。如果他们愿意给我加薪20%，让我离开开源，我可能会得到更高的薪水，如果我一开始就提出要求的话。

##### Negotiation starts early, and never ends
谈判很早就开始了，永远不会结束

Not only do you need to negotiate actively, you also need to realize that negotiation starts much earlier than you think, and ends only when you leave to a different job:
你不仅需要积极地谈判，你还需要意识到谈判比你想象的要早得多，只有当你离职去做另一份工作时才会结束:

* The minute you start thinking about applying to a company, you’ve started the negotiation process; as you’ll see, you’ll want to do research before you even talk to them.
从你开始考虑申请一家公司的那一刻起，你就已经开始了谈判过程;你会发现，在你和他们交谈之前，你会想要做研究。

* Your interview is part of your negotiation, and you can in fact negotiate the interview process itself (e.g. suggest sharing a code sample instead of doing a whiteboard puzzle).
  你的面试是你谈判的一部分，你实际上可以谈判面试过程本身(例如，建议分享一个代码样本，而不是做一个白板拼图)。

* As an employee you will continue to negotiate: if you always say “yes” when your boss asks you to work long hours, your contract for a 3-day weekend will mean nothing.
  作为一名员工，你将继续谈判:如果你总是在老板要求你长时间工作时说“好”，那么你的3天周末合同将毫无意义。

In short, your whole relationship as an employee is based on negotiation.
简而言之，你作为员工的整个关系都是建立在谈判的基础上的。

##### Distinguish between friend and foe
分清朋友和敌人

A negotiation involves two sides: yours, and the company’s. When you’re negotiating it’s important to remember that anyone who works for the company is on the company’s side. Not yours.
谈判涉及双方:你的和公司的。当你在谈判的时候，要记住任何在公司工作的人都是站在公司这一边的。不是你的。

```
I once had to negotiate the intellectual property agreement at a new job. My new employer was based in the UK, and it had a US subsidiary organized by a specialist company. These subsidiary specialists had provided the contract I was signing.
我曾经在一份新工作中不得不谈判知识产权协议。我的新雇主总部设在英国，在美国有一家由专业公司组建的子公司。这些附属专家提供了我正在签署的合同。

When I explained the changes I wanted to make, the manager at the subsidiary specialist told me that my complaint had no merit, because the contract had been written by the “best lawyers in Silicon Valley.” But the contract had been written by lawyers working for the company, not for me. If his claim had been true (spoiler: they were not in fact the best lawyers in Silicon Valley), that would have just made my argument stronger. The better the company’s lawyers, the more carefully I ought to have read the contract, and the more I ought to have pushed back.
当我解释我想做的改变时，子公司专家的经理告诉我，我的投诉毫无价值，因为合同是由“硅谷最好的律师”写的。“但这份合同是为公司工作的律师写的，不是为我写的。如果他的说法是正确的(剧透:他们实际上不是硅谷最好的律师)，那只会让我的论点更有说服力。公司的律师越好，我就应该越仔细地阅读合同，越应该推诿。
```

The contracts the company wants you to sign? They were written by lawyers working for the company.
公司要你签的合同?是公司的律师写的。

Human Resources works for the company, as does the in-house recruiter. However friendly they may seem, they are not working for you. And third-party recruiters are paid by the company, not you. It’s true that sometimes their commission is tied to your salary, which means they would rather you get paid more. But since they get paid only once per candidate, volume is more important than individual transactions: it’s in their best interest to get you hired as quickly as possible so they can move on to placing the next candidate.
人力资源和内部招聘人员都为公司工作。不管他们看起来多么友好，他们都不是为你工作的。第三方的招聘人员是由公司付费的，而不是你。的确，有时他们的佣金与你的薪水挂钩，这意味着他们宁愿你拿更多的薪水。但由于他们只能从每名候选人那里得到一次报酬，所以交易量比单个交易更重要:尽快找到你符合他们的最佳利益，这样他们才能继续安排下一位候选人。

Since all these people aren’t working for you, during a negotiation they’re working against you.
既然所有这些人都不是为你工作，那么在谈判中他们就是在与你作对。

The only potential exception to this rule are friends who also work for the company, and aren’t directly involved in the negotiation process: even if they are constrained in some ways, they’re probably still on your side. They can serve as a backchannel for feedback and other information that the company can’t or won’t share.
唯一可能的例外是，你的朋友也在这家公司工作，没有直接参与谈判过程:即使他们在某些方面受到约束，他们可能仍然站在你这边。它们可以作为反馈和其他公司不能或不愿分享的信息的主渠道。

#### Principle #2: Knowledge is power
原则2:知识就是力量

The more you know about the situation, the better you’ll do as a negotiator. More knowledge gives more power: to you, but also to the company.
你对情况了解得越多，你作为谈判者就会做得越好。知识越多，力量越大:对你来说是这样，对公司来说也是这样。

##### Know what you want
知道自己想要什么

The first thing you need to do when negotiating is understand what you want.
谈判时你要做的第一件事是了解你想要什么。

* What is your ideal outcome?
你理想的结果是什么?

* What can you compromise on, and what can’t you compromise on?
什么是你可以妥协的，什么是你不能妥协的?

* What is the worst outcome you’re willing to accept?
你最不愿意接受的结果是什么?

##### Do your research
做你的研究

You also want to understand where the other side is coming from:
你还需要了解对方来自哪里:

* What is the company’s goal, and the negotiator’s goal? For example, if you discover their goal is minimizing hassle, you might be able to get what you want by making the process a little smoother.
公司的目标是什么，谈判者的目标是什么?例如，如果您发现他们的目标是尽量减少麻烦，那么您可以通过使过程变得更顺畅来得到您想要的东西。

* What resources are available to them? An unfunded startup has different resources than a large company, for example.
他们有什么可用的资源?例如，没有资金的初创公司与大公司拥有不同的资源。

* Has the company done something similar in the past, or will your request be unprecedented? For example, what hours do other employees in similar positions work? How much are other employees paid?
公司是否在过去做过类似的事情，或者你的要求是前所未有的?例如，其他从事类似工作的员工工作时间是多少?其他员工的工资是多少?

* What do other companies in the area or industry provide?
该地区或该行业的其他公司提供什么?

* How is this particular business segment doing: are they losing money, or doing great?
这个特定的业务部门是如何运作的:他们是在赔钱，还是做得很好?

The more you understand going in, the better you’ll do, and that means doing your research before negotiation starts.
你对谈判了解得越多，你就会做得越好，这意味着在谈判开始前要做好调查。

**Applying the principle:** In my story above I never did any research about salaries, either in NY or in Boston. As a result, I had no idea I was being offered a salary far below market rates.
应用原则:在我上面的故事中，我从来没有做过任何关于薪水的调查，不管是在纽约还是在波士顿。结果，我根本不知道我得到的薪水远低于市场水平。

As a comparison, here’s a real example of how research can help your negotiation, from an engineer named Adam:
作为对比，下面是一个真实的例子，研究如何帮助你谈判，来自一个名叫亚当的工程师:

```
Adam: “Being informed on salaries really helped my negotiating position. When my latest employer made me an offer I asked them why it was lower than their average salary on Glassdoor.com. The real reason was likely ‘we offer as little as possible to get you on board.’ They couldn’t come up with a convincing reason and so the salary was boosted 10%.”
亚当:“了解薪资情况对我的谈判地位很有帮助。当我的新雇主给我一份工作时，我问他们为什么比Glassdoor.com网站上的平均工资要低。真正的原因可能是“我们提供的服务越少越好。”’他们找不到一个令人信服的理由，所以加薪10%。”
```

Glassdoor is a site that allows employees to anonymously share salaries and job reviews. Five minutes of research got Adam a 10% raise: not bad at all!
Glassdoor是一个允许员工匿名分享薪水和工作评估的网站。五分钟的研究让亚当加薪10%:还不错!

##### Listen and empathize
倾听和理解

If you only had to make yourself happy this wouldn’t be a negotiation: you need to understand the other side’s needs and wants, what they’re worrying about, what they’re feeling. That means you need to listen, not just talk: if you do, you will often gather useful information that can help you make yourself more valuable, or address a particular worry. And you need to feel empathy towards the person you’re talking to: you don’t need to agree or subordinate yourself to their goals, but you do need to understand how they’re feeling.
如果你只想让自己开心，这就不是谈判了:你需要了解对方的需求和要求，他们在担心什么，他们在想什么。这意味着你需要倾听，而不仅仅是说:如果你这样做了，你将经常收集有用的信息，这些信息可以帮助你让自己更有价值，或者解决一个特别的担忧。你需要对与你交谈的人产生同理心:你不需要同意或服从他们的目标，但你需要理解他们的感受。

##### Share information carefully
小心翼翼地分享信息

Sharing information at the wrong time during a negotiation can significantly weaken your position. For example, sharing your previous salary will often anchor what the company is willing to offer you:
在错误的时间分享信息会严重削弱你的地位。例如，分享你以前的薪水通常会决定公司愿意给你什么:

```
Adam: “I graduated from university and started working at the end of 2012. At my first job I worked for way under my market rate. I knew this and was OK with it because they were a good company.
亚当:“我大学毕业，2012年底开始工作。我第一份工作的薪水远低于市场平均水平。我知道这一点，也没有问题，因为他们是一家好公司。

Then I switched jobs in 2013. What I hadn’t accounted for was that my salary at my first job was going to limit my future salary prospects. I had to fight hard for raises at my next job before I was in line with people straight out of school, because they didn’t want to double my salary at my previous company.”
然后我在2013年换了工作。我没有考虑到的是，我第一份工作的薪水会限制我未来的薪资前景。我不得不在我的下一份工作中努力争取加薪，直到我和那些刚从学校毕业的人一样，因为他们不想让我在上一家公司的工资翻倍。”
```


In general, when interviewing for a job you shouldn’t share your previous salary, or your specific salary demands—except of course when it is helpful to do so. For example, let’s say you’re moving from Google to a tiny bootstrapped startup, and you know you won’t be able to get the same level of salary. Sharing your current salary can help push your offer higher, or used as leverage to get shorter hours: “I know you can’t offer me my previous salary of $$$, but here’s something you could do—”. Just make sure not to share it too early, or they might decide you’d never accept any offer at all and stop the interview process too early.
一般来说，在面试一份工作的时候，你不应该分享你以前的工资，或者你具体的工资要求——当然除非这样做是有帮助的。举个例子，假设你从谷歌转到一家小型初创公司，你知道你将无法获得相同水平的薪水。分享你现在的薪水可以帮助你得到更高的薪水，或者用来缩短工作时间:“我知道你不能给我以前的$$$，但是你可以做些事情——”只是要确保不要过早地告诉他们，否则他们可能会决定你永远不会接受任何工作机会，并过早地终止面试进程。

Most of the time, however, you shouldn’t share either your previous salary or specific salary requirements. If the company insists on getting your previous salary, you can:
然而，大多数情况下，你不应该分享你以前的工资或具体的工资要求。如果公司坚持要你以前的工资，你可以:

* If you work somewhere with relevant laws (e.g. California and Massachusetts), point out that this question is illegal. Asking about salary expectations is not illegal in these jurisdictions, so be careful about the distinction.
如果你在一个有相关法律的地方工作(比如加州和马萨诸塞州)，指出这个问题是非法的。在这些地区，询问薪资要求并不违法，所以要小心这种区别。

* Ask for the company’s salary range for the position, as well as the next level up in the salary tree. Chances are they will refuse to share, in which case you can correspondingly refuse to share your information.
询问该职位的公司薪资范围，以及薪资树中的下一个级别。很有可能他们会拒绝分享，在这种情况下，你也可以相应地拒绝分享你的信息。

* Say something like “I expect to be paid industry-standard pay for my experience.”
可以这样说:“我希望根据我的经验获得行业标准的薪酬。”

**Applying the principle:** I shouldn’t have told ITA Software my salary requirement. Instead, I should have gotten them to make the first offer, which would have given me more information about what they were willing to pay.
应用原则:我不应该告诉ITA软件我的工资要求。相反，我应该让他们提出第一个报价，这样我就能得到更多关于他们愿意支付多少的信息。

#### Principle #3: Negotiate from a position of strength
原则3:站在有利的位置上谈判

The stronger your negotiation position, the more likely you are to get what you want. And this is especially important when you’re asking for something abnormal, like a 3-day weekend.
你的谈判立场越强，你就越有可能得到你想要的。这一点在你要求不正常的事情时尤其重要，比如3天的周末。

##### Have a good fallback (BATNA)
有一个好的后备(巴特那)

If negotiation fails, what will you do? Whatever it is, that is your fallback, sometimes known as the “Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement” (BATNA). The better your fallback, the better your alternative, the stronger your negotiating position is. Always figure out your fallback in advance, before you start negotiating.
如果谈判失败，你会怎么做?无论如何，这是你的退路，有时被称为“谈判协议的最佳选择”(BATNA)。你的退路越好，你的选择就越好，你的谈判地位就越稳固。在你开始谈判之前，一定要提前想好自己的退路。

For example, imagine you’re applying for a new job:
例如，想象你正在申请一份新工作:

* If you’re unemployed and have an empty bank account, your fallback might be moving in with your parents. This does not give you a strong negotiating position.
如果你失业了，银行账户空了，你可以搬去和父母同住。这并不能给你一个强有力的谈判地位。

* If you’re employed, and more or less content with your current job, your fallback is staying where you are. That makes your position much stronger.
如果你被聘用了，对目前的工作或多或少感到满意，你的退路就是待在原地不动。这让你的地位更加稳固。

If you have a strong fallback, you can choose to walk away at any time, and this will make asking for more much easier.
如果你有很强的退路，你可以选择在任何时候离开，这将使要求更多更容易。

##### Provide and demonstrate value
提供和展示价值

The more an organization wants you as an employee, the more they’ll be willing to offer you. The people you’re negotiating with don’t necessarily know your value: you need to make sure they understand why you’re worth what you’re asking.
一个组织越想要你成为一名雇员，他们就越愿意提供给你更多。与你谈判的人不一定知道你的价值:你需要确保他们明白你的要求为什么值得。

For example, when you’re interviewing for a job, you need to use at least part of the interview to explain your value to your prospective employer: your accomplishments and skills. Once you’ve established the value of your skills, asking for more—more money, unusual terms—can actually make you seem more valuable. And having another job offer—or an existing job—can also help, by showing you are in demand.
例如，当你面试一份工作时，你至少需要利用面试的一部分时间向你未来的雇主解释你的价值:你的成就和技能。一旦你确定了你的技能的价值，要求更多——更多的钱，不同寻常的条件——实际上会让你看起来更有价值。另一份工作——或者现有的工作——也会有所帮助，因为这表明你很抢手。

Finally, remember that your goal is to make sure the other side’s needs are met—not at your own expense, but if they don’t think hiring you is worth it, you aren’t going to get anything. Here’s how Alex, another programmer I talked to, explains how he learned this:
最后，记住你的目标是确保对方的需求是可以满足的——不是以你自己为代价，而是如果他们认为雇佣你不值得，你将得不到任何东西。下面是另一位与我交谈过的程序员亚历克斯解释他是如何学习到这一点的:

```
Alex: “Think about the other person and how they’re going to react, how you can try to manage that proactively. You need to treat your negotiating partner as a person, not a program.
亚历克斯:“想想其他人，他们会有什么反应，你该如何积极应对。你需要把你的谈判伙伴当成一个人，而不是一个程序。

Initially I had been approaching it adversarially, 'I need to extract value from you, I have to wrestle you for it’ but it’s more productive to negotiate with an attitude of 'we both need to get our needs met.’ The person you’re talking to is looking to hire someone productive who can create value, so figure out how can you couch what you want in a way that proactively addresses the other person’s concerns.”
一开始我是用一种相反的态度来处理这件事的，“我需要从你身上获取价值，我需要和你角力”，但是用一种“我们都需要满足自己的需求”的态度来谈判更有成效。’和你谈话的那个人想要雇佣的是能创造价值的有生产力的人，所以你要弄清楚你如何能以一种主动解决他人担忧的方式来表达你的想法。”
```


#### Principle #4: Use the right tactics
原则4:使用正确的策略

Once you’ve realized you’re negotiating, have done your research, and are negotiating from a position of strength, applying the right negotiation tactics will increase your chances of success even more.
一旦你意识到你正在谈判，做了调查，并且站在有利的立场上谈判，运用正确的谈判策略将会增加你成功的机会。

##### Ask for more than you want
要求比你想要的更多

Obviously you don’t want to ask for less than what you want. But why not ask for exactly what you want?
显然，你不想要求比你想要的少。但为什么不问问自己到底想要什么呢?

First, it might turn out that the company is willing to give you far more than you expected or thought possible.
首先，结果可能是公司愿意给你比你预期或认为可能的更多的东西。

Second, if you ask for exactly what you want there’s no way for you to compromise without getting less than what you want. By asking for more, you can compromise while still getting what you wanted.
第二，如果你想要的正是你想要的，那么你就没有办法在得到的少于你想要的情况下妥协。通过要求更多，你可以在得到你想要的东西的同时妥协。

**Applying the principle:** If I’d wanted a $72,000 salary, and research suggested that was a fair salary, I should have asked for $80,000. If I was lucky the company would have said yes; if they wanted to negotiate me down, I would have no problems agreeing to a lower number so long as it was above $72,000.
应用这一原则:如果我想要7.2万美元的薪水，研究表明这是一个公平的薪水，我应该要求8万美元。如果我幸运的话，公司会同意;如果他们想和我谈判，我同意一个更低的数字，只要它高于72,000美元。

##### Negotiate multiple things at once
同时处理多项事务

Your goal when negotiating is not to “win.” Rather, your goal is to reach an agreement that passes your minimal bar, and gets you as much as is feasible. Feasibility means you also need to take into account what the other side wants as well. If you’ve reached an impasse, and you still think you can make a deal that you like, try to come up with creative ways to work out a solution that they will like.
谈判时你的目标不是“赢”。相反，你的目标是达成一项协议，通过你的最低标准，让你尽可能多的可行。可行性意味着你也需要考虑到对方想要什么。如果你已经陷入僵局，你仍然认为你可以达成一个你喜欢的协议，尝试想出创造性的方法来解决这个问题，他们会喜欢的。

If you only negotiate one thing at once, every negotiation has a winner and a loser. For example, if all you’re negotiating is salary, either you’re making more money, or the company is saving money: it’s a zero-sum negotiation. This limits your ability to come up with a solution that maximizes value for you while still meeting the other side’s needs.
如果你一次只谈一件事，每一次谈判都有赢家和输家。例如，如果你谈判的全部内容都是工资，你要么赚更多的钱，要么公司在省钱:这是一场零和谈判。这限制了你的能力，提出一个解决方案，最大限度地为你的价值，同时仍然满足对方的需要。

**Applying the principle:** In my story above, the financial company wanted intellectual property protection, I wanted to be able to write open source, and we were at an impasse. So they expanded the scope of the negotiation to include my salary, which allowed them to make tradeoffs between the two—more money for me in return for what they wanted. If I’d cared less about working on open source I might have accepted that offer.
应用原则:在我上面的故事中，金融公司想要知识产权保护，我想要能够编写开放源码，而我们陷入了僵局。因此，他们扩大了谈判的范围，把我的薪水包括在内，这让他们可以在为我多挣两倍钱的同时，换取他们想要的东西。如果我不那么关心开源的工作，我可能会接受这个提议。

##### Never give an answer immediately
永远不要立即回答

During the actual negotiation you should never decide on the spot, nor are you required to. If you get a job offer you can explain that you need a little time to think about it: say something like “I have to run this by my spouse/significant other/resident expert.” This will give you the time to consider your options in a calmer state of mind, and not just blurt out “yes” at the first semi-decent offer.
在实际的谈判中，你不应该当场做出决定，也不应该被要求这样做。如果你得到了一份工作，你可以解释说你需要一点时间来考虑一下:比如这样说:“我必须让我的配偶/重要的人/常驻专家来做这件事。”这将给你时间以更冷静的心态来考虑你的选择，而不是在第一次半正式的提议时就脱口而出“是”。

Having someone else review the offer is a good idea in general; a friend of mine ran her job offers by her sister, who had an MBA. But it’s also useful to mention that other person as someone who has to sign off on the offer. That gives you the ability to say you’d like to accept an offer, but your spouse/expert thinks you can do better.
一般来说，让别人来审核这份工作是个好主意;我的一个朋友通过她有MBA学位的姐姐找到了工作。但是，如果你提到另一个人必须在合同上签字，那也是很有用的。这让你有能力说你愿意接受一份工作，但你的配偶/专家认为你可以做得更好。

Notice that the employer almost always has this benefit already. Unless you’re negotiating with the owner of the business, you’re negotiating with an agent: someone in HR, say. When you make a demand, the HR person might say “I have go to check with the hiring manager”, and when they come back with less than you wanted it’s not their fault, they’re just passing on the bad news. The implication is that the low offer is just the way it is, and there’s nothing they can do about.
请注意，雇主几乎总是已经享有这种福利。除非你是在和企业老板谈判，否则你是在和一个代理人谈判:比如说，某个人力资源部的人。当你提出要求时，人力资源部的人可能会说:“我得和招聘经理核实一下”，而当他们拿回来的比你想要的少的时候，这不是他们的错，他们只是传递坏消息。言下之意是，低报价就是这样，他们对此无能为力。

Don’t fall for this trick: they often can change the offer.
不要上当:他们经常可以改变出价。

#### Beyond negotiating for salary
不谈薪水

You can negotiate for a higher salary—or rather, you should negotiate for a higher salary. The Adam I interviewed in this article is now a partner in DangoorMendel, [who can help you negotiate a higher salary](https://www.dangoormendel.com/).
你可以争取更高的薪水，或者更确切地说，你应该争取更高的薪水。本文中采访的Adam I现在是DangoorMendel的合伙人，他可以帮助你协商更高的薪水。

But salary isn’t the only thing you can negotiate for. You can also negotiate for a shorter workweek.
但是薪水并不是你可以谈判的唯一条件。你也可以争取缩短一周的工作时间。

And yes, this is harder, but it’s definitely possible.
是的，这很难，但这绝对是可能的。

In fact, this article is an excerpt from a book I wrote to help you do just that: You Can Negotiate a 3-Day Weekend. It’s on sale for 30% off until December 3rd, 2019.
事实上，这篇文章是我写的一本书的节选，这本书可以帮助你做到这一点:你可以争取3天的周末。截止到2019年12月3日，特价30%。
